## Introduction

The Bank Management System is a Java-based project that simulates a digital ATM allowing users to create a bank account, deposit and withdraw cash, check their remaining balance after transactions, and generate a mini statement to view recent transactions. This project provides a convenient and secure way for users to manage their bank accounts digitally.

## Features

1. **Account Creation**: Users can create a new bank account by providing their personal details like name, account number, and initial deposit amount.

2. **Deposit and Withdraw**: Account holders can deposit or withdraw cash using the digital ATM interface.

3. **Balance Check**: Users can check their account balance to stay updated with their financial status.

4. **Mini Statement**: The system generates a mini statement that records the recent transactions made by the account holder.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
- An integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ
- A Database server like MySql 8.0
- Git (optional, for version control)


## How it Works

The Bank Management System utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create classes for accounts and transactions. It maintains account details and transaction history using data structures like arrays or lists. The system prompts users for input and validates the data to ensure the accuracy of transactions.

Upon account creation, the user's details are stored in a database on the MySQL Server, and a unique account number and PIN is generated. For deposits and withdrawals, the system updates the account balance accordingly and records the transaction in the mini statement. Users can check their balance, and the system will display the recent transactions.

## Updated Enhancements Include

1. Implementation a user authentication system with passwords and PINs for added security.

2. Allowing users to choose from an increased range of services

3. Enhanced User Interface aiming on increased accessibility.
